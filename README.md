# 📊 Tableau_Project_Analysing_Customer_Churn_through_Dashboards

## 🔍 Project Overview

Investigated a dataset from an fictional telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. Answered these questions by creating calculated fields and various visualizations in Tableau, such as dual-axis graphs and scatter plots. Made graphs dynamic by using filters and parameters, and combined everything into a story to share your insights.

This project focuses on analyzing why customers are churning. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights through visually compelling dashboards that support data-driven decision-making.
