# 📊 Analyzing Customer Churn with Tableau 

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project delves into the churn rates of a fictional telecom company, Databel, aiming to uncover insights about customer behavior. Understanding churn involves more than just knowing the churn rate; it requires identifying the root causes and devising strategies to reduce customer attrition. By leveraging Tableau's advanced features like calculated fields, dual-axis graphs, scatter plots, filters, and parameters, this analysis transforms raw data into actionable insights through compelling visual dashboards.

## 🧠 Insights & Takeaways

- **Insight 1:** Total churn rate stands at 26.86%, with competitors offering better deals as the leading cause.
- **Insight 2:** California exhibits the highest churn rate, predominantly among customers on month-to-month contracts.
- **Insight 3:** Older customers are more prone to churn, whereas younger individuals and those in family/group plans show lower rates.
- **Insight 4:** Customers often churn when they subscribe to plans they underutilize, resulting in higher perceived costs.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Enable drill-down capabilities for granular analysis
- Incorporate dynamic parameters to enhance interactivity
- Expand datasets to analyze longitudinal trends
